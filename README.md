The Me, in turn, pledges equally solemnly to be far too lazy to ever check up on you, so if you do manage to pull 
some chicks The Me won't have a cow. However The Me would be sorely disappointed if The You 
were to try and sell or distribute this work without acknowledging The Me. Seriously. The Me will come down on 
The You like a large quantity of hard and heavy objects that in large quantities may be harmful and possibly even 
lethal to The You; So don't even think about it, The Buster.
